4. **Find the Server IP Address:**
   In the shortcut details window, you will find the IP address of the server. In this case, the IP address of the server is 172.16.60.18    
5. **SSH to the Server:**
   Use the obtained IP address to SSH into the server using the following command:
   ```
   ssh username@ipaddress                     
   ```
6. **Copy the configuration script and tutorials:**
   ```
   cp -r -a /CMC/* /home/username
   cd /home/username/untether
   ```
7. **Change permission of your directory and files**
   ```
   chmod-R a+rwx /home/username/untether
   ```   
8. **Check Available Accelerators:**
Once connected to the server, type the following command to see available accelerator cards in the system:
   ```
   lspci | grep accelerator
   ```
The output of this command will display the available accelerator cards, such as:
   ```
   yassine@tenstorrent:~$ lspci | grep accelerator
b1:00.0 Processing accelerators: Device 1e52:faca
ca:00.0 Processing accelerators: Device 1e52:faca
   ```
8. **Activate the virtual environment:**
``` 
yassine@tenstorrent:~$ source /CMC/tt/bin/activate
(tt) yassine@tenstorrent:~$
```
10. run TT-SMI
```
(tt) yassine@tenstorrent:~$ tt-smi
```
12. copy examples to your home directory
```
cp -rf /CMC/tt-buda-demos/ .
```
13. run resnet
``` 
cd /home/yassine/tt-buda-demos/model_demos/cv_demos/resnet
python pytorch_resnet.py
```
